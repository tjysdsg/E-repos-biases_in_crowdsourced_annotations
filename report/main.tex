        This document is a supplement to the general instructions for *ACL authors. It contains instructions for using the \LaTeX{} style files for ACL conferences.
        The document itself conforms to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of what your manuscript should look like.
        These instructions should be used both for papers submitted for review and for final versions of accepted papers.

    \section{Introduction}

    The Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus\footnote{\url{https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/}} is a large crowdsourced natural language
    inference dataset~\cite{snli}.
    For each premise sentence, annotators were asked to write a hypothesis that is either a contradiction,
    neutral statement, or entailment of the premise.

    The data was collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing service.
    Previous studies have shown that MTurk crowd-workers tend to have lower income, higher education levels, and
    lower average ages~\cite{mturks_demography}.
    We believe that biases are inevitably propagated from the dataset authors to the premise text, and from the
    crowd-workers to the hypothesis text.
    Therefore, we will analyze the biases in the data by performing word association tests in this report.


    \section{Method}

    \subsection{Pointwise Mutual Information}

    Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) is used to measure how much word $w_i$ is associated with word
    $w_j$~\cite{pmi,speech_and_nlp_book}.
    PMI is calculated as follows:

    \[
        \text{PMI}(w_i, w_j) = log_2\frac{N\cdot c(w_i, w_j)}{c(w_i)c(w_j)}
    \]
    where $N$ is the total number of sentences in the corpus,
    $c(w_i,w_j)$ is number of times $w_i$ and $w_j$ co-occur in a sentence,
    $c(w_i)$ is the number of times $w_i$ occurs in the corpus,
    and $c(w_j)$ is the number of times $w_j$ occurs in the corpus.

    Note that if a pair of words $w_i$ and $w_j$ occurs multiple times in the same sentence, $c(w_i,w_j)$ is counted
    as $1$.

    PMI ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity.
    Large PMI suggests high word association.
    Negative PMI implies two words co-occur less often than by chance and is unreliable in
    practice~\cite{speech_and_nlp_book}.


    \section{Experiments}

    \subsection{Data Preprocessing}

    As mentioned before, each data sample contains a premise and a hypothesis.
    Note that multiple hypotheses might be generated from the same premise, therefore duplicated premise text is
    removed.
    All words are converted into its lower case form and stop words are removed.
    Then we use \texttt{spaCy}~\cite{spacy} \texttt{en\_core\_web\_sm} model to tokenize raw strings into
    lists of words and remove all punctuations.

    Note that words that occurs less than $10$ times in the corpus are removed.

    \subsection{Unigram PMI}

    We first perform unigram PMI analysis on the entire corpus, and then on the premise text and the hypothesis text
    individually.

    For each analysis experiment, we focus on the most associated words with a set of
    identity labels~\cite{identity_labels}.
